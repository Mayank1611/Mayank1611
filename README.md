Hi there! I'm @mayankjha1611👋, A data science and people management enthusiast 👩‍💻.

I lead a team of 75+ students at [Gen-Y events](https://instagram.com/geny_events?igshid=OGRjNzg3M2Y=).
I am an associate lead of operations at TEDX SRMIST.

In my free time I like to read and watch Anime. In my not so free time I like to help organise events and learn Data Science. 

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to take a look around!
